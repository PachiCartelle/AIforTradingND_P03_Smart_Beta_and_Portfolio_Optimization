# Smart_Beta_and_Portfolio_Optimization_Project

In this project, we will build a smart beta portfolio and compare it to a benchmark index. 

To find out how well the smart beta portfolio did, we will calculate the tracking error against the index. 

Then we will build a portfolio by using quadratic programming to optimize the weights. 

Our code will rebalance this portfolio and calculate turn over to evaluate the performance. Finally we will use this metric to find the optimal rebalancing Frequency.

For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.

This proyect is the third one in the Artificial Intelligence for Trading Nanodegree from Udacity.
